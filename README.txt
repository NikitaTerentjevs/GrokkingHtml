  #GrokkingHTML
  
  Dear Sir/Madam
  Thank you for paying attention to my project git-page and reading this readme.txt file.
This project is deploed in Githup Pages at https://nikitaterentjevs.github.io/GrokkingHtml*/libs* and,
as you probably noticed, normal link wont work because i store my index.html file so it is required to add */libs* for it to work.
  All contents on those webpages are original. Also if you noticed, in Additional info part thats not information about me, but about original artist that asked me to make site for him, so I decided to join this work with my Technical school project. Plus there will be possobility to observe how web page progressed from scratch to finished product.
  Thanks for reading this README file!
  May only good thing happen with You!
